Heya folks, here are some general guidelines to keep things streamlined
1. Regularly use Git to commit recent changes 
2. To Naavin & Kuan : Work on scripts in the Phase 1 (Coding) folder, and upon completion move it to Phase 2
3. To Rachel : Work on scripts in the Phase 2 (Design) folder, and upon completion move it to Phase 3 for further review 
4. Have fun and try out new things! =)
